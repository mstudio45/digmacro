## What is This?

DIG Macro is a tool that automatically plays the minigame in the roblox game [DIG](https://www.roblox.com/games/126244816328678/DIG).

## How does this work?

DIG Macro uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) and computer vision to detect when to click inside the digging minigame. It uses pywebview which is a wrapper around a web browser to create a custom GUI.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üì• Download and Run

> [!WARNING]
> Some antivirus software may flag the standalone (pre-built) version as a **false positive**. <br />
> This is a common issue with **binary files (`.exe`/`.app`/`.bin`)** generated using Python compilers such as **Nuitka** or **PyInstaller/auto-py-to-exe**. These tools bundle Python code into a single binary file, which can sometimes trigger antivirus alerts despite the code being completely safe. <br /> <br />
> **All of our code is open source and publicly available!**

**If you still cannot open the app after pressing open anyway (like not launching)** You can use the following command in terminal after changing directories to whereever the digmacro_macos.app file is found:

```bash
cd /path/to/digmacro_macos.app # Change this to the actual path where digmacro_macos.app is located like ~/Downloads/
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine digmacro_macos.app
open digmacro_macos.app

## ‚èπÔ∏è How to Stop the Macro

> [!NOTE]
> Keybind Shortcuts are not supported on macOS due to certain Python and OS restrictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Editing the Configuration

You can easily change how the macro works using a simple graphical interface.

### üîß How to Open the Configuration

Follow the same steps as running the macro, but when asked **"What would you like to do?"**, simply select **Edit the configuration** to edit the configuration instead of starting the macro.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Pathfinding Macros (Movement Patterns)

The macro can move your character in different patterns (like a square, line, etc.). You can use the built-in patterns or create your own.

### ‚ûï How to Add or Edit Movement Patterns

1. **Open the File:**  
   Go to the `storage` folder and open `pathfinding_macros.json` with a text editor (like Notepad).

2. **Understanding the Format:**  
   Each pattern is a list of steps. Each step tells the macro which key(s) to press and for how long.

   - **Single Key:**  
     `"w"` means press W.
   - **Multiple Keys:**  
     `["w", "d"]` means press W and D together.
   - **Duration:**  
     The number (like `1.0`) is how many seconds to hold the key(s).

   **Example:**

   ```json
   "square": [
       ["w", 1.0],
       ["d", 1.0],
       ["s", 1.0],
       ["a", 1.0]
   ]
   ```

3. **Add Your Own Pattern:**  
   Add a new entry with your chosen name and steps.  
   For example, to add a "vertical_line" pattern:

   ```json
   {
     "vertical_line": [
       ["w", 2.0],
       ["s", 2.0]
     ],
     "square": [
       ["w", 1.0],
       ["d", 1.0],
       ["s", 1.0],
       ["a", 1.0]
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Save the File:**  
   After editing, save the file. Your new pattern will appear in the configuration GUI.

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Computer Vision is at the wrong place.**
  - Go to the `storage` folder and delete `region.json` file. Then you will be prompted to re-select your minigame region again.

- **Macro is missing clicks or not working well:**
  - The macro‚Äôs speed can be affected by several factors:
    1) Your CPU performance and Roblox FPS also impact how well the macro runs
    2) **mss on Windows** slows down the macro because of VSync

  - If you're having issues, try the following:
    1) Lower your in-game graphics and enable "Low Graphics" inside DIG settings
    2) Close background applications (ideally only have the macro and Roblox running)
    3) Adjust the configuration (MIN_CLICK_INTERVAL, TARGET_FPS, USE_PREDICTION, PLAYER_BAR_DETECTION)
    4) Change your screen resolution (for example 1080p to 720p)

- **Running from source with macOS is not working well:**
  - This may be due to using Python from Homebrew, please uninstall Python from homebrew and install it from the official site for the best experience running from source.
  
- **Need help?**
  - Check the [Changelogs](CHANGELOGS.md) for updates or create a new issue in this repository.
